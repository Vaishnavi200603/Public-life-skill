# Good Practice for Software Development

## Question 1 - Which point(s) were new to you?

1. Sometimes despite all efforts, the requirements are still vague. So during the implementation phase, get frequent feedback so that you are on track and everyone is on the same page.
2. Requirements have changed? - If the current deadline will not be met due to the changes, inform relevant team members about the new deadline.  

## Question 2 - Which area do you think you need to improve on? What are your ideas to make progress in that area?

1. On my communication.
2. Deep focus.
3. Social media distraction.
4. Exercise and being healthy.
