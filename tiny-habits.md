#Tiny Habits

## Question 1 - In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?

Long-term habits are built by taking smaller actions. Smaller actions can be completed when these three cause of behavior genrated - 
1. Motivation
2. Ability to do things
3. Action to trigger behaviour

## Question 2 - How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A and P.

I use this B = MAP, by making my work divide into smaller tasks (means making my motivation equivalent to my ability to do task at certain point/or day)
Take Action Prompt (means one behaviour triggers the another)
Like After I come to office, I will do the check-in.

M means motivation that we need to perform a task.
A means ability, if our ability matches with motivation we will continue doing task.
P means prompt, making mind ready for doing certain task. This is of 3 types - External, Internal and Action Prompt. 

## Question 3 - Why it is important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of habit? (This is the most important concept in today's topic. Whatever you celebrate becomes a habit)

When we celebrate or "Shine" our success(or even tiny successful action), it will automatically increase the confidence and motivation level.
It teach our mind that our success frequency is increased, whenever we celebrate even the size of success is small.
