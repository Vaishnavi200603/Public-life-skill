#Tiny Habits

## Question 1 - In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?

Long-term habits are built by taking smaller actions. Smaller actions can be completed when these three causes of behavior are genrated - 
1. Motivation
2. Ability to do things
3. Action to trigger behavior

## Question 2 - How can you use B = MAP to make new habits easier? What are M, A and P.

I use this B = MAP, by making my work divided into smaller tasks (which means making my motivation equivalent to my ability to do the task at a certain point/or day)
Take Action Prompt (means one behavior triggers the another)
Like After I come to office, I will do the check-in.

M means motivation, that leads us to perform some task.
A means ability, if our ability matches with motivation we will continue doing task.
P means prompt, making the mind ready for doing certain tasks. This is of 3 types - External, Internal and Action Prompt. 

## Question 3 - Why it is important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of habit? (This is the most important concept in today's topic. Whatever you celebrate becomes a habit)

When we celebrate or "Shine" our success(or even a tiny successful action), it automatically increases our confidence and motivation. It teaches our mind that our success frequency is increased.

## Question 4 - In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?

There are 4 stages of habit formation - noticing, wanting, doing and liking.

Any habit can be built -
1. When we notice something nice or successful (Noticing also means getting clarity on something or becoming more aware of something).
2. After noticing, we want that thing. That wanting creates the urge to take action and enjoy our success after that. (Wanting can be caused by external noticing or the environment we live in)
3. Doing or taking an action to achieve something, making us better at it or we started liking that thing.
4. Liking or continuing with the habit that we form.

## Question 5 - What is the book's perspective about Identity?

Books Perspective -
1. Make Habits that make us what we want to become or achieve in the future.
2. Our habits shape our identity (Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement)
3. Real Change comes from small change or small habit (1% change)
4. Time Magnifies the margin of success and failure.

## Question 6 - Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit easier to do?

1. When we make our minds to build a system rather than setting goals.
2. Work on building identity (makes habits that become part of us).
3. Solve problems at the system level.
4. Say it loud - what you want to achieve.
5. When we follow the cue, caving, response and reward process.

## Question 7 - Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit harder to do?

1. When we focus more on our goals rather than process.
2. When we focus on output or accomplishments rather than input.
3. When we live in an environment that gives us a negative perspective.

## Question 8 - Pick one habit that you would like to do more of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue obvious or the habit more attractive or easy and or response satisfying?

Work on my Programming/Coding Skills. 

- Divide my work into small tasks.

- Make sure my environment aligns with my perspective.

## Question 9 - Pick one habit that you would like to eliminate or do less of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue invisible or the process unattractive or hard or the response unsatisfying?
