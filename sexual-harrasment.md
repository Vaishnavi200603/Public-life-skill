# Prevention of Sexual Harassment

## What kinds of behavior cause sexual harassment?

Any behavior that makes someone uncomfortable, or unsafe due to some comments, gestures or actions can be categorized as sexual harassment.

Sexual harassment can be verbal, physical, or cyber. 

## What would you do in case you face or witness any incident or repeated incidents of such behavior?

If we face or witness any incident or repeated incident of such behavior, we can do certain things;

### Take Action
Keeping quiet in a situation that makes you uncomfortable is never a good solution. It will give the other person authority to do that again. Tell them that you do not like such things—this may include sexist jokes, an unwanted friendly nature, commenting on one's body parts or family condition, or any other such things.

### Report To Senior
Sometimes, things are out of your control, and you may not be able to take and call out that person. In that case, it is advisable to report your concern to a senior person—they can be HR, your manager, or any authoritative law person outside your workplace.

### Take an Image or Video
If we see something like that, we can click some pictures of that incident or create a video as a record to show other seniors or peers that what's the actual truth. And if it is online harassment, take screenshots or do a screen recording.

### Be Accountable
It may happen that sometimes we only tell someone and participate in an activity that makes others uncomfortable. So, being accountable for such things and accepting our mistakes can be a good thing.
