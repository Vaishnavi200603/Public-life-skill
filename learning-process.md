# Learning Process

## Question 1 - What is the Feynman Technique? Explain in 1 line.

A Feynman Technique is a concept of explaining any concept in easier way.

## Question 2 - In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?

The interesting idea I find in this video, is that it is okay to start learning anytime in your lifetime. There is no compulsory starting point. 

Also the idea - don't just follow your passion, broaden your passion and your life is enriched beyond measure.

## Question 3 - What are active and diffused modes of thinking?

Active mode is where our mind is totally focused towards something, and we don't feel easily distracted.

On the other hand, diffused mode is a relaxed state of mind, where it is difficult to focus. It's basically a state of mind where we are jumping in between of thoughts and can't simply concentrate on one.

But diffused mode help us to think broader than the perspective we have in focused mind. It is suggested to be in diffused mode, when we feel stucked or feel harder to grasp anything with our focused minds.

## Question 4 - According to the video, what are the steps to take when approaching a new topic? Only mention the points.

Steps we could while approaching new topic;

1. Construct the idea of how to learn - Understand what you actually want to learn and how you achieve that target.

2. Correct yourself while learning - learn the basics first so it's easier to correct yourself at the hard or complex topics, as we already understood the basic. It's like self editing your mistake by previous learned things.

3. Remove Distraction - means being into more and more focused zone.

4. Practice More(Atleasst 20 hours) - while learning something at first seems harder and remains hard till we don't practice as much as it get clear it our head. Or we can use Feynman Technique to became better at a topic.

## Question 5 - What are some of the actions you can take going forward to improve your learning process?

Some Actions I am going to take to improve my learning process;

1. Practice more
2. Teach Other
3. Be more in focused mode
4. Make learning fun
